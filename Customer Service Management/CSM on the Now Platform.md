# CSM on the Now Platform
## Customer Service Management from Service Now
CSM is a way for service providers to manage relatiopnships between themselves and the customers who use and/or purchase their services and products.  The process itself should not be confused with an application designed to help manage and improve the process.  The latter is where ServiceNow's Customer Service Management Application plays a part, a very large part.

ServiceNow's CSM reconciles Omni-channel Customer Engagement across the portal, call center, email, and chat; improving the customer experience.

It offers customer management with skill based routing, real-time Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Service Contracts, and Service entitlements.  Faster response and resolution reduce contractual SLA penalties and warrenty leakages to improve service revinues and reduce costs.

Customer Service provides an end-to-end service management solution with integreated Problem, Change, Configuration, and Work Order management, as well as a structured Service Catalog.  It helps break down classic silos and automate processes across middle office teams to resolve issues faster, by connecting customer service with engineering, field service, finance, and other teams to drive accountability for resolution.  This approach allows the business to scale.

> Encourage customers to help themselves with a self-service catalog, knowledge base, customer community, and portal

>### Monitor for issues and create cases automatically
>Proactively monitor customers' services and products and take action on potential issues and outages

> ### Prevent Future Cases
> Fix underlying issues to eliminate cases, drive knowledge base content changes, preemtively notify customers, and act on trends revealed in performace analytics.

## CSM Guided Setup
CSM Guided Setup provides:
- A sequence of tasks and checklist to help administrators configure
- Percentage of activities completed
- Controls to start, skip, and mark tasks as completed
- Plugin management
- Links between CSM and other applications like ITSM, ITOM, SPM, KM, and PPM
- A link to Community and FSM Guided Setups

### Why use Guided Setup
To setup CSM a System Administator is required to configure many modules as well as potentially integrations with other ServiceNow products on the platform.  Multiple components which include setting up accounts, contacts, contracts, case management, communication channels, [[Business Models#Business to Business B2B|B2B]] and [[Business Models#Business to Consumer B2C|B2C]] portals, and others is often confusing and requires a lot of reading.

The structured way of working that Guided Setup offers, can be of great help to control the configuration steps during a CSM implementation.  It does not imply the System Administrator is obliged to restrict their actual configuration approach soley to this solution.
