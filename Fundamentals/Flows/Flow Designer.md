  - **Robust:** provides configuration and runtime information to create, operate, and troubleshoot flows from a single interface.
  - **User-Friendly:** provides natural language descriptions of flow logic.
  - **Repeatable:** promotes process automation by enabling subject matter experts to develop kand share reusable actions.
  - **Scalable:** allows extending flow content by subscribing to IntegrationHub or installing spokes.

Each flow consists of a trigger and one or more actions.

**Triggers:** When the trigger conditions are met the flow will execute the actions.

**Actions:** Each action is a reusable operation that enables process analysts to automate Now Platform features without having to write code.  Different  actions are strung together to make a flow.

**Integrations:** You can expand the Flow Designer solution to integrate with external instances and third-party applications with a seperate subscription to IntegrationHub.  The integrations available using IntegrationHub are referred to as **[[Triggers#^Spoke|Spokes]]**.  They add powerful new sets of actions to Flow Designer without the need to write a script.
