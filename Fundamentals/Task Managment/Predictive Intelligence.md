# Predictive Intelligence
**Predictive Intelligence:** Uses machine-learning algorithms to determine field values during record creation.  Existing data records are required to "train"  machine-learning to make effective decisions.

### Results in improved efficiency and quality and reduces cost by:
- Reducing the amount of time spent resolving [[Tasks|tasks]]
- Reducing the number of interactions required to resolve [[Tasks|tasks]]
- Reducing the number of potential human errors that could occur while categorizing and [[Assigning Tasks|assisgning work]]
