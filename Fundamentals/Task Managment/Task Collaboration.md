# Task Collaboration
### User Presence
**User Presence:** Facilitates synchronous collaboration within one record.  It allows you to see who is online, their current status, and what they are viewing or editing, all in real-time. ^d2c493

**Real-Time Editing:** An extension of [[Task Collaboration#^d2c493|user presence]] and improves collaboration by allowing you to edit records in real-time as well as see edits (indicated by a pulse icon) saved by other users using interfaces or devices such as Visual Task Boards, Connect Chat, [[Now Platform#^aa0021|Service Portal]], [[Now Platform#^98d32e|ServiceNow mobile apps]], and Apple Watch.  This collaboration reduces record reslution from days to minutes.

## Notes Tab
**Notes Tab:** allows you to communicate with stakeholders and document task activities throughout the lifecycle for internal and external audiences.

### Important things about Notes Tab
- **Work notes** are only visible to those working on the task
- **Additional comments (customer visable)** are visable to customers (callers).
- **Activity** is a read-only record entry made when the record is created or updated
