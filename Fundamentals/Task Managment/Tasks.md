# Tasks
**Task:** any record that can be assigned or completed by a user in ServiceNow.  Users create tasks and are notified as the task moves along a workflow.  Tasks can be assigned to specific user groups.

### Why use tasks?
The power (and value) of tasks are that they are repeateble processes across the enterprise.  By defining tasks, users with similar issues (for example, no network access) can have their issue automatically assigned to the appropriate user and assignment group.  This results in quicker resolution times and minimizes the possibility of human error.

## Task Workflow
1. **Incident submitted:** Upon coming back to work after a long vacation, Fred realizes he can no longer access the corporate network.  Eager to get back to work, he submits an incident.
2. **Incident assigned:** Because the incident is network-related, it is automatically assigned to Donna in the Network group.  Getting the incident routed to the correct person quickly helps resolve the incident faster.
3. **Incident in progress:** Since Donna has been assigned Fred's incident, the State of the incident is updated to "In Progress".
4. **Incident Resolved:** Once Donna fixes Fred's network access issue she updates the State to indicate the incident is "Resolved".
5. **Increased customer satisfaction:*** Once Fred receives notification indicating that his issue has been resolved, he verifies that he has network access.  He is pleased that the response time was short and required little effort on his side.
