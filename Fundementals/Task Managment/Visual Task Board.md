### Visual Task Board Usage
- Manage [[Tasks|tasks]] through a visual, drag-and-drop interface.
- Identifty process bottlenecks at a glance.
- Track activity to view updates all in one place.

### Three Types of Boards

**Guided:** Can be created from a list and use the values of a specified field (e.g. state) as lanes.  [[Tasks|Tasks]] in this list are updated when cards are edited or change lanes on the Visual Task Board.

**Flexible:** Also created from a list, but lane changes do not update underlying [[Tasks|task]] data.

**Freeform:** Act as a personal organizer to manage individual tasks of any kind.  Lane changes do not update underlying [[Tasks|task]] data.
